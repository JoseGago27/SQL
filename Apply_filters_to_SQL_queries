Apply filters to SQL queries

Project description
You are a security professional at a large organization. Part of your job is to investigate security issues to help keep the system secure. You recently discovered some potential security issues that involve login attempts and employee machines.
Your task is to examine the organization’s data in their employees and log_in_attempts tables. You’ll need to use SQL filters to retrieve records from different datasets and investigate the potential security issues.

Retrieve after hours failed login attempts
There was a potential security incident that occurred after business hours (after 18:00). All after hours login attempts that failed need to be investigated.
The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for failed login attempts that occurred after business hours.

SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_time > ‘18:00:00’ AND success = 0;

Retrieve login attempts on specific dates
A suspicious event occurred on 2022-05-09. Any login activity that happened on 2022-05-09 or on the day before needs to be investigated.
The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for login attempts that occurred on specific dates.

SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE login_date = ‘2022-05-09’ OR login_date = ‘2022-05-08’;

Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico
After investigating the organization’s data on login attempts, I believe there is an issue with the login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico. These login attempts should be investigated.
The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico. 

SELECT *
FROM log_in_attempts
WHERE NOT country LIKE ‘MEX%’;

Retrieve employees in Marketing
My team wants to update the computers for certain employees in the Marketing department. To do this, I have to get information on which employee machines to update.
The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for employee machines from employees in the Marketing department in the East building.

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = ‘Marketing’ AND office LIKE ‘East%’;

Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales
The machines for employees in the Finance and Sales departments also need to be updated. Since a different security update is needed, I have to get information on employees only from these two departments.
The following code demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for employee machines from employees in the Finance or Sales departments.

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE department = ‘Sales’ OR department = ‘Finance’;

Retrieve all employees not in IT
My team needs to make one more security update on employees who are not in the Information Technology department. To make the update, I first have to get information on these employees.
The following demonstrates how I created a SQL query to filter for employee machines from employees not in the  Information Technology department.

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE NOT department = ‘Information Technology’;

Summary
I applied filters to SQL queries to get specific information on login attempts and employee machines. I used two different tables, log_in_attempts and employees. I used the AND, OR, and NOT operators to filter for the specific information needed for each task. I also used LIKE and the percentage sign (%) wildcard to filter for patterns.
